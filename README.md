For ActBlue filings, ProPublica provides state-specific CSV downloads (see [example](https://projects.propublica.org/itemizer/committee/C00401224/2020/filings/1385527/downloads)). Given a specific filing and state, grab those CSV files and load them into a SQLite database, then browse them with Datasette.
